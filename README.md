#Ghost_BMI_Calculator

Hello hello friends I'm super happy to make this particular commit. because I promised you to start graphical interfaces in python and this is the first mini application with pseudo database that I created in python. Of course I would like to point out that the project is not inspired by me, but don't stop that it is me who realizes it and in the future, I will make projects based on my own inspiration.
Well to come back to the application it's the BMI calculator that I had already created in console mode so I'll spare you the details.
